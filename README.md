# SMARTY BIRD

This is a reproduction of the game "Flappy Bird" with a genetic deep
neural network AI, made by Luxedo and Faifos. The game is made using
[p5.js](https://p5js.org) and nothing more.

Besides playing the regular game, you can train a neural network that
has 4 inputs and a bias term. The deep layer has 3 neurons and another
bias. The output is a single neuron. All of the neurons uses `tanh` as
the activation function. The bird *flaps* its wings if the output
neuron is activated (if it has a positive value).

The network is trained with a genetic algorithm. The best bird is
allowed to breed and fill 50% of the population. Variance is introduced
by altering the neurons randomly with a 50% chance.

Let the birds train for a while and after some generations they will be
better than you.
